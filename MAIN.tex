% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
%\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
\usepackage{import}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{ae,aecompl}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{bibliography}
%\bibliography{example} % if your bibtex file is called example.bib


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
% This method is tedious and prone to error if you have lots of references
% \begin{thebibliography}{99}
% \bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Author}{2012}]{Author2012}
% Author A.~N., 2013, Journal of Improbable Astronomy, 1, 1
% \bibitem[\protect\citeauthoryear{Others}{2013}]{Others2013}
% Others S., 2012, Journal of Interesting Stuff, 17, 198
% \end{thebibliography}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% APPENDICES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \appendix

% \section{Some extra material}

% If you want to present additional material which would interrupt the flow of the main paper,
% it can be placed in an Appendix which appears after the list of references.
