With the upcoming arrival of new generation multi-epoch and multi-band astronomical surveys, there is a demand for computational techniques that automate the study and detection of astronomical sources. One such kind of sources are transient events, which pose a difficulty in recognition that no other astronomical object has, due to their time-dependant nature. In this work we propose a new process to recognize and classify such kinds of events with machine learning algorithms. Using thousands of unique transient and non-transient event light-curves from the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we experimented  with multiple data pre-processing methods, feature selection techniques and self-learning models. State of the art results were obtained in five classification tasks: particularly there was one binary and four multi-class classification tasks. In our research we discovered that the best performing algorithm was Random Forests, which achieved a f1-score of 87.27\% on binary (transient \& non-transient) classification. Six-class transient classification achieved a 77.54\% f1-score, and an additional 66.39\% f1-score when including an ambiguous sources class with new samples. Variations on the multi-class transient classifications mentioned above, those which included non-transient sources, resulted in a 75.05\% f1-score and a 66.05\% f1-score respectively.

%%% NEW MULTI EPOCH SURVEYS ENABLE STUDY AND DETECTION IN CRAZY SCALES
The study and detection of astronomical variable sources is expected to occur in unprecedented scales with the new generation of forthcoming multi-epoch and multi-band (synoptic) astronomical surveys. To give an example, The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) (\cite{0805.2366}), one of the largest synoptic survey telescopes to come in the following years, will generate approximately 15 terabytes of data every night (\cite{1512.07914}). 
%Such telescope is expected to detect and alert about 10 million possible transients too. 
Other surveys including the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) are expected too to daily generate exuberant data-streams.

%%% HISTORICALLY IT HAS BEEN DONE MANUALLY, NOW IT ISN"T POSSIBLE
Thus, with the newest sky surveys old-school astronomical object classification techniques may not be feasible anymore. Traditionally, such objects have been classified manually by astronomers or through crowd-sourcing (\cite{1011.2199} \& \cite{0708.2750}). Since manual classification a process in which humans directly intervene, it is slow and expensive. Other concerns exist too, since hand-made classification tends to be biased and hard to standardize among astronomers (\cite{1104.3142}). Alternatively, transient detection can be executed much faster than human astronomers through computational techniques using machine learning, which are deterministic and calculate the results' degrees of certainty. These innovative methods also allow for real-time triggering of follow-up observations that optimize the economical and temporal resources. Showing thus that new methodologies are taking over the older techniques, which are becoming unfeasible with the advent of the next generation of surveys. 


%%% TRANSIENTS EVENTS ARE CHALLENGES (AND WHAT TRANSIENT EVENTS ARE)
One of the many several new objects classification challenges in Time Domain Astronomy is Real-Time Transient classification. Astronomical Transients are events which's luminosity varies in short duration relative in the timescale of the universe, from minutes to several years. Transients include phenomena such as supernovae, novae, neutron stars, blazars, pulsars, cataclysmic variable stars (CV), gamma ray bursts (GRB) and active galaxy nucleus (AGN). The time-domain dependency of these objects is one of the reasons why they are hard to classify: their data is usually heterogeneous, unbalanced, sparse, unevenly sampled and with missing information. Automating the recognition and classification of transient events, a type of such variable sources, would reduce costs and speed up this process as well as provide scientists information of the universe in various spacial scales (\cite{2011arXiv1110.4655D}).

%%% HOW DOES TRANSIENT DETECTION
Transient and variable star detection is generally done through a process named difference imaging (\cite{1507.05137}, \cite{1608.01733} \& \cite{1708.02850}). It consists in aligning the image of interest on a reference image of the same region of sky, processing the former to match it's point-spread function in all regions with the latter's, and subtracting both (\cite{astro-ph/9712287}). As a result, variable stars and transient objects which were not visible in the reference image will remain in the resulting image. Nonetheless, resulting difference images will also contain additional artificial (bogus) artifacts generated in the process, which occur due to imperfections in the image processing phase, in the telescope used or due to natural phenomena. Unfortunately, distinguishing between bogus and real objects is still a hand-made process which is expensive and slows down knowledge discovery (\cite{2011arXiv1110.4655D}).


%%% STATE OF THE ART I: REAL VS BOGUS
Successful attempts to detect real objects from such bogus artifacts have been tested by astronomers. Raw images from the  Skymapper Supernova and Transient Survey and the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) have been used as inputs for automatic detection algorithms (\cite{1708.08947} \& \cite{1701.00458}). In specific, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been trained for this binary classification task, achieving high accuracies. Other studies have shown that bogus artifacts can be detected using features extracted from raw images. In \cite{1601.06151} and \cite{1601.06320}, reliable classification is enabled by transforming transient data from the OGLE-IV data-reduction pipeline and training it with machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Similarly, \cite{1501.05470} uses images from Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Surveys, and \cite{1407.4118} utilizes single-epoch multi-band images from the SDSS supernova survey for the same purpose.


%%% STATE OF THE ART II: DIRECT

Alternative approaches try to classify astronomical transient events directly, skipping the difference imaging process.
This is usually done by extracting relevant features (e.g. periodic, non-periodic) from the astronomical object light-curves, and using machine learning algorithms for classification. For instance, in \cite{1401.3211} and \cite{1601.03931}, light curves of objects six or more transient classes from the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey and the Downes set (\cite{d05}) were classified. Other studies which research a similar approach include \cite{1603.00882}, where supernovas from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge were automatically classified.

Direct use of light curves as data inputs is also currently under research. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been proven succesful to classify transient events. In \cite{1606.07442} and \cite{1710.06804} it is evident how more modern algorithms can also learn from time-series data without much pre-processing.

% PROPOSAL
In this work we test different techniques to automatically classify transient events with machine learning, using their light curves. Namely: filtering them by their observation count, oversampling unbalanced light curve classes and extracting several statistical descriptors from the resulting data. Such generated statistics are used as input to three different machine learning models with several hyper-parameter variations: Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks and Random Forests, which automatically learn to detect and classify between different types of transient objects. With extensive testing, multiple experiments were executed in order to find the best training parameters. This lead to state of the art and novel experimental results.

% STRUCTURE
The paper is structured as it follows: in Section \ref{section_data} we present the dataset used for this project. Section \ref{section_method} describes the methodology proposed. Section \ref{section_experimentation} explains the experiments performed to classify transient objects with machine learning. Finally, the results are discussed in Section \ref{section_results}.

\section{Data} \label{section_data}
%\import{./chapters/}{2.data.tex}
%%% Overview

In this work we make use of data from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) (\cite{1111.2566}). As it's name implies, the CRTS is an astronomical survey in the search of transient and highly variable objects. It covers 33,000 squared degrees of the sky in search of this kind of objects and has surveyed astronomical sources since 2007. Three telescopes are used to capture data from the sky: Mt. Lemmon Survey (MLS), Catalina Sky Survey (CSS), and Siding Spring Survey (SSS). So far, CRTS has discovered more than 15.000 transient events.

Specifically, this work uses the light curves of 4269 unique transient events (each of which contains at least 5 observations), which were detected with the CSS telescope of the CRTS. This f/1.8 Schmidt telescope is located in the Santa Catalina Mountains, north of Tucson, Arizona. It is equipped with a 111-megapixel (10,560 x 10,560 pixel) detector, and covers 4000 square degrees per night, with a limiting magnitude of 19.5 in the visual filter band.
%\cite{css}.

\import{./figures/ObjCount/}{5.tex}

All transient objects are classified in the CRTS data-set according to their type. The most relevant classes found are: supernovae (SN), cataclysmic variable stars (CV), blazars, flares, asteroids, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and high-proper-motion stars (HPM). Though most objects in the transient object catalogue belong to a single class, there's uncertainty is present in the categorization of some of them. (an interrogation sign is used when a class is not clear e.g. SN? or sometimes multiple possible classes are found for a single event e.g. SN/CV) (Table \ref{Top-Transient-Classes}).

Furthermore, the data-set used in this project contains information of 15193 non-transient sources that have at least 5 observations each. Sources in this data-set were selected by sampling light curves of objects within a 0.006 degree radius from CRTS detected transients, and removing known transient light curves from that set. Though this process should return only non-transient sources, it is possible that non-detected transients were captured and catalogued incorrectly as 'non-transients'.

Note that in general, when capturing information with telescopes, errors may arise in the measurements. This may be due to multiple factors, such as the variable atmospheric conditions affecting the capturing device. In the CRTS, these uncertainties have been calculated for each event observation using an empirical relationship between the source flux and the observed photometric scatter.%\cite{CRTS_FAQ}. 
Such relation was derived based on 100,000 isotropically selected sources that showed non-significant variability based on their Welch-Stetson index (\cite{1996PASP..108..851S}).

Table \ref{Transient-Observation-Count} and Table \ref{Non-Transient-Observation-Count} summarize the light curve observation count statistics for the transient and non-transient data-sets respectively.

\section{Methodology} 
\label{section_method}
%\import{./chapters/}{3.method.tex}
The methodology applied in this work consists of six stages: filtering out irrelevant light curves, oversampling light curves, extracting descriptive features from the curves, processing them into feature vectors, re-scaling those resulting feature vectors, and performing classification with the use of machine learning algorithms. The details of each step are detailed below.

\subsection{Data Filtering} 
\label{subsection_filtering}

Astronomical object light curves with few observations may not contain enough information to be classified correctly by machine learning algorithms. 
This is why we decided to test the behaviour of our classification algorithms with light curves that contained higher averages of observations. Precisely, an additional sub-set of light curves was generated by filtering out those which had less than 10 observations.


\subsection{Oversampling Transient Light Curves} \label{subsection_oversampling}

The dataset's number of transient event light curves per class was unbalanced. Thus, an oversampling step was implemented to test the behaviour of the classification algorithms when using the same amount of elements for each class.

In this project, oversampling means artificially generating multiple light curves, each based on a 'real' one. New curves were obtained by going through each observation of a given light curve, and generating a similar data-points independently for each synthetic curve.

Every artificial observation created for a new light curve was sampled from a Gaussian distribution function centered on the base observation's apparent magnitude, with the magnitude's error used as standard deviation.

\subsection{Feature Extraction} \label{subsection_extraction}

In general, astronomical observations are spread through time at irregular intervals, and their corresponding light-curves do not necessarily have the same number of observations. Given characteristic makes it very challenging to directly use the time-series data for classification with traditional methods. To solve this difficulty, a set of characteristic features were extracted from each light curve, using statistical and model-specific fitting techniques. Some measurements used in this project were formally introduced in \cite{1101.1959}, and have been used in other studies including \cite{1603.00882} and \cite{1601.03931}.

In total, 30 features were used in this project. These features were computed for all light curves, and can be classified according to their origin in four groups: moment-based, magnitude-based, percentile-based and fitting-based. The groups are presented next.

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item Moment-based features use the magnitude for each light curve.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Beyond1std} (\textit{beyond1std}): 
        Percentage of observations which are over or under one standard deviation from the weighted average. Each weight is calculated as the inverse of the corresponding observation's photometric error.
        \item \underline{Kurtosis} (\textit{kurtosis}): 
        The fourth moment of the data distribution. Used to measure the heaviness or lightness in the tails of the statistical data.
        \item \underline{Skewness} (\textit{skew}): 
        A measurement of the level of asymmetry from the normal distribution in a data distribution. Negative skewness is the property of a more pronounced left tail, while positive skewness is a characteristic that implies a more pronounced right tail.
        \item \underline{Small Kurtosis} (\textit{sk}):
        Small sample kurtosis.
        \item \underline{Standard deviation} (\textit{std}):

        The Welch-Stetson J variability index \cite{1996PASP..108..851S}. A robust standard deviation.
        \item \underline{Stetson K} (\textit{stetson\textunderscore k}): 
        The Welch-Stetson K variability index \cite{1996PASP..108..851S}. A robust kurtosis measure.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Magnitude-based use the magnitude for each source.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Amplitude} (\textit{amp}): 
        The difference between the maximum and minimum magnitudes.
        \item \underline{Max Slope} (\textit{max\textunderscore slope}): 
        Maximum absolute slope between two consecutive observations.
        \item \underline{Median Absolute Deviation} (\textit{mad}): 
        The median of the difference between magnitudes and the median magnitude.
        \item \underline{Median Buffer Range Percentage} (\textit{mbrp}): 
        The percentage of points within 10\% of the median magnitude.
        \item \underline{Pair Slope Trend} (\textit{pst}): 
        Percentage of all pairs of consecutive magnitude measurements that have positive slope.
        \item \underline{Pair Slope Trend 30} (\textit{pst\textunderscore last30}): 
        Percentage of the last 30 pairs of consecutive magnitudes that have a positive slope, minus percentage of the last 30 pairs of consecutive magnitudes with a negative slope.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Percentile-based features use the sorted flux distribution for each source. Flux is calculated as $F = 10^{0.4mag}$. Defining $F_{a,b}$ as the difference between the $b$ and $a$ flux percentiles.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Percent Amplitude} (\textit{p \textunderscore amp}): 
        Largest percentage difference between the absolute maximum magnitude and the median.
        \item \underline{Percent Difference Flux Percentile} (\textit{pdfp}): 
        Ratio between $F_{5,95}$ and the median flux.
        \item \underline{Flux Percentile Ratio Mid20} (\textit{fpr20}): 
        Ratio $F_{40,60} / F_{5,95}$
        \item \underline{Flux Percentile Ratio Mid35} (\textit{fpr35}):

        \item \underline{Flux Percentile Ratio Mid50} (\textit{fpr50}): 
        Ratio $F_{25,75} / F_{5,95}$
        \item \underline{Flux Percentile Ratio Mid65} (\textit{fpr65}):

    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Polynomial Fitting-based features are the coefficients of multi-level terms in polynomial curve fitting. These is a new set of features proposed in this paper. They use the magnitude for each source.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \underline{Poly1 T1}: Linear term coeff. in monomial curve fitting.

        \item \underline{Poly4 T4}: Quartic term coeff. in quartic curve fitting.
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

The computed features were grouped in the following sets for experimentation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \underline{20 feats:} This sub-set includes all moment-based, magnitude-based and percentile-based features.
    \item \underline{26 feats:} This sub-set includes all features, except quartic curve fitting parameters (poly4).
    \item \underline{30 feats:} This sub-set includes all moment-based, magnitude-based, percentile-based and fitting-based features.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Feature Scaling} \label{subsection_scaling}
Two feature scaling procedures were used in this project, in order to weight equally each feature when training machine learning algorithms. This process was applied independently to every single light curve feature. The first re-scaling procedure, named standardization, recalculates the values such that their updated mean is zero and they have unit variance. The second re-scaling feature used was normalization, which transforms features by re-scaling them to the range $[0,1]$. Note that these techniques were used exclusively in distinct experiments as explained in the experimentation section (Section \ref{section_experimentation}).

\subsection{Classification} \label{subsection_classification}

Five classification tasks were performed with the homogeneous computed feature vectors.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Binary Classification}: 
    Distinguish transients from non-transients. A balanced number of events from both classes is used to investigate the capability of distinguishing between these different types.
    \item \textbf{6-Transient Classification}: Recognize objects as belonging to one of the more common transient types in the dataset, namely: AGN, Blazar, CV, Flare, HPM and Supernovae. The purpose of this task was to test how well did classification algorithms perform when distinguishing only the main transient event types in the dataset.
    \item \textbf{7-Transient Classification}: Recognize objects as belonging to one of the more common transient types in the dataset or as a different transient, namely: AGN, Blazar, CV, Flare, HPM, Other and Supernovae. The Other class was created by using objects from ambiguous and under-represented classes such as the ones described in Section \ref{section_data}. In this scenario we wanted to understand how well these Other classes were detected when grouped together, and how the performance of the 6-Transient Classification Task was altered with the addition this new class.
    \item \textbf{7-Class Classification}: Recognize objects as belonging to one of the more common transient types in the dataset or as a Non-Transient object. The classes used were: AGN, Blazar, CV, Flare, HPM, Non-Transient and Supernovae. This task was developed with the purpose of understanding if classifiers could classify correctly the main transient types when the non-transient events were present.
    \item \textbf{8-Class Classification}: Recognize objects as belonging to any of the the following classes: AGN, Blazar, CV, Flare, HPM, Other, Non-Transient and Supernovae. The Other class was created by using objects from ambiguous and under-represented classes. This task was done to search how well was classification executed when testing together all the main classes that were present in the previous tasks.
\end{enumerate}

Three different algorithms were used for classification: neural networks, random forests and support vector machines. These algorithms were chosen because they were found to be popular in existing studies. Moreover, these three algorithms can perform quickly classification under the low dimensional feature data used, which means that their use in production pipelines may be studied too. Details on the inner workings of these machine learning models can be found in \cite{9780387848570}

To train machine learning models, it is required to define the training and testing processes. In our project, we made sure that the training data did not contain oversampled light curves based on any other present in the test samples, since this could suppose a bias. We also made sure that the test samples did not contain oversampled light curves, for the same reason. Additionally, since the number of objects in the class sub-sets was small we used 2-fold cross validation during training for result validation. Moreover, grid search was used during training to test multiple hyper-parameter configurations for each one of the possible algorithms. The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model was the F1-Score. Finally, a test set was initially set aside for each task, and final scores were based on the prediction performance of the trained algorithms with these data subsets.


\subsection{Feature Importance} \label{subsection_importances}

Once the tasks were run and the best classifiers were obtained, we generated a list of the most relevant features. This was done using the best Random Forest classifier for each task. The goal behind this proposal was to understand which features contributed the most to the classification task. Doing this is critical in a machine learning context, since finding optimal feature sets enable lower computation times by sacrificing a little performance.

\section{Conclusions}
%\import{./chapters/}{6.conc.tex}

This project presents an approach for the automatic recognition of transient events with the use of machine learning techniques. Given proposal was developed under the scope of forthcoming astronomical synaptic surveys such as the LSST (\cite{0805.2366}). 

The method introduced in this project consists in oversampling filtered light curves, then extracting characteristic features from them, and finally using those features as inputs to machine learning algorithms. The features extracted from light curves were either statistical descriptors of the observations, or polynomial curve fitting coefficients applied to the light curves.  
Three different machine learning models were trained with the resulting measurements.

A variety of classification tasks were researched. Namely, binary classification among transients and non-transients, and multi-class classification of various transient classes, sometimes including non-transients too. Detailed description of these tasks can be found in Section \ref{section_method}. 
Overall, the best classifier for all tasks was the Random Forest, followed by Neural Networks and then Support Vector Machines.

For the sake of experimentation, each task was executed several times with different data subsets. Given subsets corresponded to the decision of selecting parameter value combinations, including: balancing classes or not, using either 30, 26 or 20 features only and linearly-scaling or standardizing feature vector values.

State of the art results were obtained when testing the trained models to unseen sets of data, specifically in binary and transient multi-class classification. Recall scores obtained from the best classifier for each task, are equivalent to those results found in \cite{1401.3211} and \cite{1601.03931}.


The best experimentation parameters were also investigated. 
Training with light curves which contained 10 observations minimum generally outperformed those with minimum 5. Overall, the best results were also achieved using all 30 features per light curve, while using 20 features overall performed worst. Such phenomena may be explained due to the lower noise that curves with more observations provide.
Since light-curves with higher observation count may be better defined, they could generate a more precise higher rank polynomial fitting that non-transients, which were the newly proposed features found in the 26 and 30 feature sets.
In general, training with unbalanced-class data sets resulted in the highest values. Contrary to what was expected, the usage of oversampled light-curves may be a factor that biases the model during training. This could be explained if such artificial light curves were too similar to the original ones, and thus the algorithms over-fitted during training.

Feature importance was also studied based on the best performing models for each task (Random Forests). An analysis resulted in the identification of the most relevant and least important features regardless of the experiment in which they were used. In detail, the best feature was always stetson\textunderscore j, followed by: amplitude, standard deviation, skewness and median absolute deviation. Conversely, 4th level polynomial fitting coefficients were the ones which provided the least relevance, though using them was still better, since the highest scores were a result of using all 30 features. Furthermore, lower polynomial fitting features like poly2\textunderscore t1 and poly1\textunderscore t1 were proven to be beneficial for classification, scoring much a higher importance.

The methodology proposed in this project, together with the positive results lay the foundations on the development of more robust Transient Object Classifiers. This research becomes a base for the work of Research groups at Universidad de los Andes and CPPM keep exploring the field, groups that also look forward to contribute to the new age of synoptic surveys.

%\section{Future Work} 
%\label{future_work}

Though the obtained results demonstrate that the methodology proposed works well, final scores are far from perfect. Results are not significantly better than what the state of the art already obtained, meaning there are still more improvements to develop in order to construct better classifiers which are usable in next-generation astronomical surveys. 

Finding clean information is one of the hardest tasks when using photometric data. Astronomical data-sources tend to be obscure and hard to deal with, which makes it difficult to understand the information that is being gathered. Having said that, a critical improvement on transient recognition would be to train the algorithms with cleaner data. This means data with lower amount of duplicates and errors, and specifically, using a more reliable non-transient data-set. 

Expanding the methodology presented may be beneficial too. Using additional features could also increase the classifiers performance. Moreover, different classification algorithms can also be tested for a better detection of transient objects.

Finally, testing with other more reliable oversampling types would be beneficial for the purpose of working with limited data-sets. While the oversampled/balanced inputs increased the performance of some of the algorithms, different alternatives could improve upon the results shown in this document.
