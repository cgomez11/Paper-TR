With the upcoming arrival of new generation multi-epoch and multi-band astronomical surveys, there is a demand for computational techniques that automate the study and detection of astronomical sources. One such kind of sources are transient events, which pose a difficulty in recognition that no other astronomical object has, due to their time-dependant nature. In this work we propose a new process to recognize and classify such kinds of events with machine learning algorithms. Using thousands of unique transient and non-transient event light-curves from the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we experimented  with multiple data pre-processing methods, feature selection techniques and self-learning models. State of the art results were obtained in five classification tasks: particularly there was one binary and four multi-class classification tasks. In our research we discovered that the best performing algorithm was Random Forests, which achieved a f1-score of 87.27\% on binary (transient \& non-transient) classification. Six-class transient classification achieved a 77.54\% f1-score, and an additional 66.39\% f1-score when including an ambiguous sources class with new samples. Variations on the multi-class transient classifications mentioned above, those which included non-transient sources, resulted in a 75.05\% f1-score and a 66.05\% f1-score respectively.
