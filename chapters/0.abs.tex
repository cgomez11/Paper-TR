The arrival of massive multi-epoch and multi-band astronomical surveys
demands the development of computational techniques to automate the
study and detection of transient astronomical sources. 
In this work we characterize various machine learning algorithms to
recognize and classify such kinds of events.
We use light-curves from the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey
(CRTS) to classifity thousands of unique transient and non-transient
event light-curves.
we experimented  with multiple data pre-processing methods,
feature selection techniques and self-learning models. State of the
art results were obtained in five classification tasks, particularly
there was one binary and four multi-class classification tasks. In our
research we discovered that the best performing algorithm was Random
Forests, \textit{which scored a recall of 89.39\%} on binary
(transient \& non-transient) classification. Six-class transient
classification scored a \textit{77.86\% recall}, and an
additional \textit{66.91\% recall} when including an ambiguous sources
class with new samples. Variations on the multi-class transient
classifications mentioned above, those chich included non-transient
sources, resulted in a \textit{77.31\% recall} and a \textit{68.23\%
recall} respectively.
